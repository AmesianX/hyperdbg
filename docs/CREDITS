HyperDbg and the hardware-assisted virtual machine monitor are developed by:

    Aristide Fattori    <joystick@security.dico.unimi.it>
    Lorenzo  Martignoni <martignlo@gmail.com>
    Roberto  Paleari    <roberto.paleari@gmail.com>

The minimalistic hypervisor is inspired by Joanna Rutkowska's bluepill[1] and
Shawn Embleton's virtual machine monitor[2]. 

The x86 disassembler embedded into HyperDbg is based on the udis86 library,
authored and maintained by Vivek Thampi[3].

The version of the snprintf() and vsnprintf() we use has been developed by
Patrick Powell <papowell@astart.com>.

The font used in the GUI has been created by Droids Corporation[4].

The icon was designed by filischi[5].
