= CHANGELOG =

== 26 Dec 2010 ==

We switched from WDK compiler to GCC and we now support Linux (still experimental). See [Linux] and [Windows] renewed compilation instructions!

=== Bug Fixes: ===
Some minor bug fixes.

== 3 Aug 2010 ==

=== New Features: ===
 * New basic VM-Introspection capabilities:
   * list of _guest_ processes;           
   * list of _guest_ drivers;            
   * list of _guest_ network connections.

 * HyperDbg GUI now has a _more-like_ pager to handle commands with very long output.

 * HyperDbg now displays also the TID of the currently running thread along with the PID of the process.

 * HyperDbg is now able to intercept and handle hypercall 0xdead0002. We will use this hypercall to implement (user|kernel)space calls to the hypervisor through {{{VMCALL}}}.

 * The hypervisor now uses its own CR3.

 * PAE support added. HyperDbg can now be run on systems that use PAE too.

 * HyperDbg now automatically detects video card *and* screen resolution (XP only). Thanks to Jon Larimer. 

 * Core and HyperDbg code are now 99.9% VMX-independent.

 * HyperDbg loader now checks that VMX is not disabled by the BIOS. Thanks to Jon Larimer.

=== Bug Fixes: ===
 * Fixed issue #3: Unloading fails when PAE is enabled.
