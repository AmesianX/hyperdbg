HyperDbg is almost completely OS-Independent. However, some of its part aren't (e.g.: the installation driver). In this page we will keep and updated record of the development status of Windows version.

= Windows Support =

Windows XP is the first system HyperDbg was developed for, but even if it is still under development, this version of HyperDbg is stabler than the one used under Linux.

So far we have tested it on different hardware and emulated machines running the following versions of Windows:
 * Windows XP SP2
 * Windows XP SP3

== Compilation ==

 # Download and install `MinGW` and `MSYS` [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20101030/ here]
 # Download HyperDbg code like explained [http://code.google.com/p/hyperdbg/source/checkout here]
 # Edit Makefile.windows with your favorite editor and find the following definitions:
{{{
-DVIDEO_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION_X=
-DVIDEO_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION_Y=
-DVIDEO_ADDRESS_MANUAL
}}}
 # Modify them to your needs. If you eliminate the -DVIDEO_ADDRESS_MANUAL row HyperDbg will try to automatically retrieve your video card address.
 # Compile with the following command:
{{{
$ make -f Makefile.windows
}}}

== Known Bugs && Limitations ==

 * Trying to use HyperDbg on a Windows system where an accelerated video driver is being used will most probably lead to a failure
 * The option xpauto (-DXPVIDEO) is not currently working: see issue #4
