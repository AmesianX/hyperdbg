HyperDbg is almost completely OS-Independent. However, some of its part aren't (e.g.: the installation driver). In this page we will keep and updated record of the development status of linux support. 

= Linux Support =

Currently, the svn version of HyperDbg can be compiled with GCC. To do that, you need to have the proper kernel headers installed on your system.

We have tested it on these distro/kernels:

 * Debian *squeeze* 32bit/2.6.26.2
 * Debian *squeeze* 32bit/2.6.30.4
 * Debian *sid* 32bit/2.6.32.5

At the moment, there's no support for PAE, so no _bigmem_ kernels so far.

 * As for Windows, trying to use HyperDbg on a system where a accelerated video driver is being used will most probably lead to a failure
