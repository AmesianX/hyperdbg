HyperDbg is almost completely OS-Independent. However, some of its part aren't (e.g.: the installation driver). In this page we will keep and updated record of the development status of linux support. 

= Linux Support =

So far, linux support in HyperDbg is still experimental and far from being complete.
However, we have tested it on these distro/kernels:

 * Debian *squeeze* 32bit/2.6.26.2
 * Debian *squeeze* 32bit/2.6.30.4
 * Debian *sid* 32bit/2.6.32.5

At the moment, there's no support for PAE, so no _bigmem_ kernels.

== Compilation == 

 # Download HyperDbg from the repository, like explained here: [http://code.google.com/p/hyperdbg/source/checkout]
 # Edit Makefile.linux with your favorite editor and find the following definitions:
{{{
-DVIDEO_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION_X=
-DVIDEO_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION_Y=
-DVIDEO_ADDRESS_MANUAL
}}}
 # Modify them to your needs. If you eliminate the -DVIDEO_ADDRESS_MANUAL row HyperDbg will try to automatically retrieve your video card address.
 # Copy Makefile.linux over Kbuild
 # Compile with the following command:
{{{
$ make -f Makefile.linux
}}}

== Known Bugs && Limitations ==

 * As for Windows, trying to use HyperDbg on a linux system where an accelerated video driver is being used will most probably lead to a failure
 * We do not detect video resolution automatically
 * No support for symbols
 * No introspection techniques implemented
